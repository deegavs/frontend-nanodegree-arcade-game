# Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game

## Game Description

This classic Arcade game is a student project in the Udacity's Front-end developer program.  
Provided with the art assets, the game engine `engine.js` and resources `resources.js` from the `startup code` on this [github repository](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game),
our required task is to complete the `app.js` file by implementing javascript object-oriented programming features to build the game.

## Completing the Project.

The required tasks are to implement

1. Enemy class (constructor)

  - create an Enemy function to set the location and speed
  - update enemy method for the the Enemy's location and handle collisions with the player

2. Player class (constructor)

  - create a Player function that initiates the player
  - update the Player method
  - implement the render method for the player
  - implement player.handleInput method
  - implement Enemy render
  - implement Enemy update
  - implement allEnemies render
  - implement checkCollisions between enemy and player
  - implement reset

3. Enemy and Player objects (instances/subclasses)

  - create new player object
  - create several new Enemy objects and have them placed in a new array called allEnemies
